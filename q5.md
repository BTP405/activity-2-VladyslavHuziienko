#Approach 1
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')

This code snipet uses function doubleL to calculate a list of numbers from 0 to n multiplied by 2. 
After that the loop is used to iterate through the results of doubleL execution, and print every number.

#Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')

This code snipet uses almost the same printing loop, but instead of using a function for getting the list of numbers,
it uses shortened notation for generating list, by looping through the numbers from 0 to 5 and multiplying each by 2.

#Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : ')

This approach instaed of returning the list from the function, returns an iterator. 
That means object returned from the dobuleG function can be iterated, and will contain
data that is result of executing of the for loop in the doubleG function.

2.
doubleG is a generator function. This type of function returns an object called iterator, that can be iterated like a list.
And the main advantage of generators is that their results do not take any memory and are generated when needed. That means
generators are beneficial when large amounts of data needs to be processed, and storign lists in the memory may be not the best option.
